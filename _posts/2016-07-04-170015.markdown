title: "Optimality Of Posterior Contraction Rate And Priors"
comments: true

Recently one of my friends asked me a question about the previous post "How to prove the  Bayesian Model Selection Consistency in Linear Models for High-dimensional Settings". He was wondering the following statement in the post.

>Even though Gaussian tails hurt the optimal minimax rate of posterior contraction, it is ok when we only consider model selections.

He asked me why priors with Gaussian tail that decays square-exponential rate, i.e., $$-\log\pi(\theta)\propto O(\theta^2)$$.
