### DRAFT


Today I am going to introduce my recent work about a scalable stochastic search algorithm for high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection, which is called "Simplified Shotgun Stochastic Search with Screening" (S5). This algorithm is not only super-fast and efficient, but it is also scalable in a sense that the computational cost is robust to the dimension $$p$$.  

### Motivation

I was writing a paper about [a high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection method](http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~minsuk/publications/nonlocal_sinica7.dpf). I was so naive to try to examine 3 settings with different 40 tuning parameters and 100 datasets with $$p $$ =20000; total 12,000 high-dimensional  datasets. I found that for a each dataset it was expected to take about **2 hours** and the total simulation time was estimated about 1,000 days. Even if I used multiple cores for the computation, it was still not feasible. Practically to do the simulation, I needed some algorithm not only giving me results within **10 seconds**, but also providing an efficient uncertainty identification of the model space.

### Model

Consider a linear regression model given a model $${\bf k}$$ as 
 
$$
 y = X_{\bf k}\beta_{\bf k} + \epsilon,
 $$
 
 where $$\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2I_n)$$ and $$ X_{\bf k} $$ refers to a submatrix of $$X$$ containing the variables in the model $${\bf k}$$. The resulting posterior probability of each model  is 

$$
\pi({\bf k}\mid y) = \frac{m_{\bf k}(y)\pi({\bf k})}{\sum_{\bf l}m_{\bf l}(y)\pi({\bf l})}, 
$$  

 where $$m_{\bf k}(y)$$ is the marginal likelihood of the model $${\bf k}$$ and $$\pi({\bf k})$$ is its model prior.

However, the problem is that there exist too many possible models; the total number of possible models is $$2^p$$. Even when $$p$$ is moderate, saying 50, we cannot evaluate $$2^{50}$$ number of marginal likelihoods. 

### Issues
 *Markov Chain Monte Carlo* (MCMC) has been popular to approximate the posterior model probability. However, the fact that the computational efficiency of MCMC is not scalable (heavily depends on the dimension $$p$$ and length of the chain) hinders the usage of the algorithm in high-dimensional settings. 
 
### Shotgun Stochastic Search (SSS)
  To overcome this issue, [Hans et al. (2007)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f65/77bd4f6ce85a5637a52b18ab63b26cc74d65.pdf) proposed the *Shotgun Stochastic Search* (SSS) algorithm that efficiently explores the model space. By searching the neighborhood of a current model at each iteration, the SSS stochastically chooses which model to move. More specifically, define the neighborhood of a model $${\bf k}$$ as

$$
nbd({\bf k })=\{ \Gamma^+,\Gamma^-,\Gamma^0 \}
$$
