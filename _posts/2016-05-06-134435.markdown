 There have been a lot of interest in model selection or variable selection methods. Because many data sets have"large p, small n" problem (or high-dimensional problem), it is crucial to reduce the dimension of the data, and the simplest way is to select a small number of  variables that well-fit to the model. I am going to introduce a simple introduction of this framework in Bayesian philosophy.
 
 Let's consider a linear regression model with three predictors as follows:
 
$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ 1 i } + \beta_2  X_{ 2 i } +\beta_3 X_{3i} + \epsilon_i$$  for $$ i=1,...,n $$.
