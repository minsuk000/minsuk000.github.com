 Yesterday, I found an interesting paper from arxiv. It is about *Model Confidence Bounds* which is an extension of confidence sets in real-valued parameters to model spaces for variable selection. Let me explain the details.

 Consider a linear regression model given a model $${\bf k}$$ as 
 
 $$
 y = X_{\bf k}\beta_{\bf k} + \epsilon,
 $$
 
Then, you might be interested in finding a set $${\bf k}$$ of significant predictors associated with $y$. Suppose that using an arbitrary variable selection procedure (LASSO or Bayesian model seleciton, etc), you estimated a set of variables $$\widehat{\bf k}$$.
