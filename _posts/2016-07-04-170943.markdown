title: "The Optimality Of Posterior Contraction Rate and Priors"
comments: true

Recently, one of my friends asked me a question about the previous post "[How to prove the  Bayesian Model Selection Consistency in Linear Models for High-dimensional Settings]({% post-url 2016-06-14-213921%})". He was wondering the following statement in the post.

>Even though Gaussian tails hurt the optimal minimax rate of posterior contraction, it is ok when we only consider model selections.

He asked me why the use of priors with Gaussian tails hurt the optimal posterior contraction rate. A density with a Gaussian tail refers to a density function that decays a square-exponential rate, i.e., 

$$-\log\pi(\theta)= O(\theta^2)$$.
